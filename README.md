# Animal
The purpose of this project is to practice the concepts of Inheritance, Polymorphism and Encapsulation.

Animal is the superclass. Dog and Cat classes inherit the Animal class.
Dog and Cat have their own implementation of the isPlaying() method from Animal.

Feel free to use this repo and add/remove functionallity or implement improvements to the code!
